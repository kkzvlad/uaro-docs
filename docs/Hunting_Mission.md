# Hunting Missions — Hobota

![Hobota](img/NPC/hobota.gif)

Hunting Missions let you track down specific monsters for rewards including zeny, experience, and Mission Points.

You’ll find **Hobota** in every inn, including the Prontera inn location at `/navi prt_in 66/140`.

## How missions work

All missions:

- Each mission assigns three monsters to hunt.
- There are four difficulty levels: beginner, intermediate, advanced, and elite. Higher difficulties mean tougher monsters and bigger rewards.
- Missions can be taken solo or with a party once every 8 hours.
  
For party missions:

- All members must be online, inside an inn, and not already on a mission.
- The party leader accepts the mission, and all members receive the same objectives and rewards.
- To get kill credit, party members must be on the same screen when the monster is defeated.

### Abandoning missions
If a mission doesn’t suit you, it can be abandoned for a fee:

- Solo: 50,000z
- Party: 100,000z
  
You can immediately pick a new mission after abandoning. In parties, everyone must abandon before the leader can choose a new mission.

## Restrictions
Keep these rules in mind:

1. Only one mission can be completed every 8 hours.
2. Missions can only be accepted on one character per account.
3. Kill counts and rewards are tied to the character that accepted the mission.
4. Missions can be reset as often as you like by paying the abandonment fee.
5. Monsters killed by party members within your screen view count toward your total.

### Extra notes

- Leaving your party won’t cause you to lose a mission. You can rejoin the same group or join a new one and still hunt the monsters on your list.
- XP rewards stack with other bonuses, including weekend rates and Battle Manuals.
- Missions don’t expire: you have unlimited time to complete them.

## Mission Shop
Mission Points earned from missions can be spent on items in the Mission Shop, available at Hobota.
