# Hunting Missions — Hobota

![Hobota](img/NPC/hobota.gif)

Hunting Missions let you track down specific monsters for rewards including zeny, experience, and **Mission Points**.

You’ll find **Hobota** in every inn, including the Prontera inn location at  
`/navi prt_in 66/140`.

## How Missions Work

All missions:

- Each mission assigns **three monsters** to hunt
- There are **four difficulty levels**:
  - Beginner  
  - Intermediate  
  - Advanced  
  - Elite  
  Higher difficulties feature stronger monsters and better rewards
- Missions can be taken **solo or with a party**
- Each account can complete **one mission every 8 hours**

---

## Party Missions

For party-based missions:

- All party members must be **online**, **inside an inn**, and **not already on a mission**
- The **Party Leader** accepts the mission
- All party members receive **the same objectives and rewards**
- To receive kill credit, party members must be **on the same screen** when the monster is defeated

---

## 🎉 Hunting Mission Party Bonus

Completing Hunting Missions in a party grants **additional Mission Points** based on party size.

- Bonus is calculated as **+1 Mission Point per 2 party members**
- Encourages coordinated group play and full parties

### Party Bonus Table

| Party Size | Additional Mission Points |
|-----------:|---------------------------|
| 12 players | +6 points |
| 8 players  | +4 points |

## Abandoning Missions

If a mission doesn’t suit you, it can be abandoned for a fee:

- **Solo:** 50,000 Zeny  
- **Party:** 100,000 Zeny  

After abandoning a mission, you can immediately pick a new one.  
For party missions, **all members must abandon** before the Party Leader can select a new mission.

---

## Restrictions

Please keep the following rules in mind:

1. Only **one mission** can be completed every 8 hours
2. Missions can only be accepted on **one character per account**
3. Kill counts and rewards are tied to the **character that accepted the mission**
4. Missions may be reset any number of times by paying the abandonment fee
5. Monsters killed by party members **within your screen view** count toward your total

---

## Extra Notes

- Leaving your party **does not cancel** your mission  
  You may rejoin the same party or join a different one and continue progress
- Experience rewards **stack with all bonuses**, including weekend rates and Battle Manuals
- Missions **do not expire** — you have unlimited time to complete them
