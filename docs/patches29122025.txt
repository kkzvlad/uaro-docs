Patchnotes 29 December 2025

Gameplay
- New NoKS System
Lock* starts when: 
	- Damage is done outside of aggro range of mob
	- Mob locks onto a player target
*If a player is idle for 5 seconds or longer, aggro lock is released.
*Lock time is 15 seconds (This timer DOES NOT START until another player attempts to KS your mob)
*Lock is hard capped at 30 seconds (Will release regardless of variables.  Once expired, the owner can not claim aggro on mob but can still attack them).
*Doesn't apply to any MVP/Mini boss that has noks null and void.
*Max MOB count a player can hold - Unlimited.
Previous KS rules for non mini/mvp null and void.
System has UI with 3 options:
	- Self (Disables Party/Guild)
	- Party
	- Guild
Ols KS message is now removed, you will not be able to attack monsters/Area skills will yield 0 damage if the player is protected by the system.

- Max friend increased from 40 > 100.
	- Any variable over 40 will display as 41/40 etc due to client limitations on text but will display all names on your friend list.
