## :crossed_swords: Mercenary System Overview

Welcome to the uaRO Mercenary System guide. This page covers everything you need to know about hiring, using, and optimizing mercenaries. Whether you're a beginner or looking to master AI automation, this guide has you covered.

## :triangular_flag_on_post: Mercenary Types and Locations

There are three types of mercenaries, each found in different towns:

:crossed_swords: Swordsman – Located in Izlude, near the entrance to the Swordman job quest.

:shield: Spearman – Found in Prontera, to the left of the Knight Guild entrance.

:bow_and_arrow: Bowman – Available in Payon, on the right side of the Payon Cave entrance.

!!! info "Minimum Requirement"
     Mercenaries become available starting from Base Level 15.

!!! note
     1-7  level of scroll can be placed in storage. 8-10  level of scroll can not and will be locked to character

## :bar_chart: Leveling, Cost, and Loyalty

### :scroll: Contract Details

- Cost: 7,500z to 63,000z (depending on mercenary level)

- Duration: 30 minutes

- Unlimited contracts can be purchased

### :chart_with_upwards_trend: Mercenary Scaling

Higher contract level = stronger mercenary (skill set matters)

Mercenaries do not gain XP; stats increase with level and buffs

### :heart: Loyalty Points (LP)

Required from contract level 7+:

| Contract Level | Loyalty Required |
|----------------|------------------|
| 7              | 50 LP            |
| 8              | 100 LP           |
| 9              | 200 LP           |
| 10             | 300 LP           |

!!! warning "Level 10 Notice"
     Level 10 mercenaries consume only loyalty points, not zeny.

### :sparkles: Gaining Loyalty

+1 LP when contract ends successfully

+1 LP per 50 monsters killed, if:

Monster level ≥ your level / 2

Mercenary dealt at least 1 hit

!!! note "Loyalty is Separate"
     Loyalty is tracked individually per mercenary type (Sword, Spear, Bow).

### :x: Losing Loyalty

-1 LP if your mercenary dies

-1 LP if you die

In both cases, the contract is canceled

## :test_tube: Buffs and Potions

Mercenaries benefit from:

Priest buffs, chants, and Professor skills (not scrolls)

Their own:

Concentration Potions :dash:

Awakening Potions :zap:

Berserk Potions :boom:

HP/SP Potions :heart:/:droplet:

!!! tip "Potion Vendor"
     All potions are sold by the NPC next to the contract vendor.

!!! info "Healing"
     Heal skills work at 50% effectiveness on mercenaries.

## :crossed_swords: Strategy Guide

### :one: Let the Mercenary Do Everything

Best for low-level grinding

Ideal Merc: Spearman (Culverts 2, Spores)

AI Mode: Aggressive (Aggro HP: 1–10)

### :two: Mercenary Tanks & You Deal Damage

Best for ranged classes

Risk for melee users due to mob switching

### :three: You Tank & Mercenary Deals Damage

Effective with +HP gear (e.g., Pupa Card)

Best Merc: Bowman (ranged safe damage)

AI Mode: Defensive (Aggro HP: 100)

### :four: The Lazy Archer

Bowman + Geographers (or Floras < lvl 55)

Passive farming from level 55+

!!! tip "Grinding"
     Use maps with fast respawn and non-aggressive mobs for efficient EXP gain.  
     If you go for Geographer, here is an instant respawn Point:

## :pill: Mercenary Potions

| Potion Type          | Effect                          |
|----------------------|----------------------------------|
| Concentration Potion | Attack speed increase           |
| Awakening Potion     | Greater speed for level 4+      |
| Red/Blue Potions     | Emergency HP/SP recovery        |

!!! note
     It's cheaper to use a potion than hire a new mercenary!

## :bookmark_tabs: Final Notes

Mercenaries are a budget-friendly way to grind and survive

Combine manual control and AI for best results

Watch your LP and adapt your strategy to your class
