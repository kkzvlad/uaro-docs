# Class Changes
uaRO uses the pre-renewal class system, with selected adjustments to skills and mechanics for balance and smoother gameplay. These changes preserve the classic feel while improving the overall experience.

For full reference on unmodified pre-renewal skills, you can [visit the iRO Classic Wiki](https://irowiki.org/classic/Main_Page).
