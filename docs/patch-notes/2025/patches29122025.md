## 🎮 Gameplay

### New NoKS System

!!! success "Kill-Steal Protection Rework"
    A new aggro-based kill-steal protection system has been implemented!

**Lock starts when:**

- Damage is done outside of aggro range of mob
- Mob locks onto a player target

**Lock Mechanics:**

| Mechanic | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Idle Release** | If a player is idle for `5 seconds` or longer, aggro lock is released |
| **Lock Timer** | `15 seconds` (timer does NOT start until another player attempts to KS your mob) |
| **Hard Cap** | `30 seconds` (will release regardless of variables) |
| **MVP/Mini** | Doesn't apply to any MVP/Mini boss that has NoKS null and void |
| **Max Mob Count** | Unlimited |

!!! info "Previous KS Rules"
    Previous KS rules for non mini/MVP are null and void.

**System UI Options:**

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Self** | Disables Party/Guild |
| **Party** | Allows party members |
| **Guild** | Allows guild members |

Old KS message is now removed. You will not be able to attack monsters and area skills will yield `0 damage` if the player is protected by the system.

### Max Friend Limit Increased

- Max friend limit increased from `40 → 100`
    - Any variable over 40 will display as `41/40` etc. due to client limitations on text but will display all names on your friend list
