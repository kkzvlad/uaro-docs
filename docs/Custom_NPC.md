## Our approach
We aim for a classic, balanced experience, so you won’t find the shortcut NPCs common on heavily customized servers. Travel, quests, and party play are all part of the journey here.

### Got ideas?
If there’s a feature you’d love to see, drop your suggestions in our [Discord channel #server-suggestions](https://discord.com/channels/702960460168953946/1197554200817696898).

### Common Unbalanced NPCs Excluded
- **No Job Changer**: Advancing jobs means completing the [original quests](https://irowiki.org/wiki/Category:Job_Change_Gui), making each step feel earned.
- **No Generic Warper**: Our [quest-based dungeon warper](Warper_System.md) adds a touch of adventure to travel while still keeping things accessible.
- **No Healer or Buffer**: Healing and buffs come naturally through potions, inns, and playing together with your party.
