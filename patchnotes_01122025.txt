Patchnotes 01 December 2025

Gameplay
- The Halloween event has ended. All Halloween Coins, Deviling Coins, and Transform Candies have been removed from characters' inventories, carts, storages, etc. We will take a one-week break before launching the Christmas event.
- Assump Boxes are tradable; however, the scrolls themselves will remain trade-locked.
- Super baby now follows Super Novice logic dealing with soul link equippable items persisting through link expiration / death / map changes until swapped or removed.

- Rest Homc (Required if you have an active homc before you can access bioethics to swap).
- Calling your last called homc is still free (No embryo required).
